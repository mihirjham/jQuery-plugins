        <p>The Yorkshire Terrier is feisty, alert, inquisitive, energetic, determined, brave, bossy, scrappy and boisterous. But he can also be very sweet. He can be described as a little dog with a big personality! He's one of the most popular breeds in the Unite States. He craves close physical contact and affection and will follow you around the home like a shadow. His prey-drive is high and he will chase any little creature that scurries by him. He gets along well with strangers but he can be aggressive with other dogs. He's very affectionate and loves to cuddle and sit on your lap.</p>

        <p>The Cardigan Welsh Corgi equals big personality in a little dog. These are intelligent, active, alert little guys who will want to be the center of your world. They love to be with their families, and will shower you with loyalty, devotion and affection. They need daily exercise and love to take long walks with you. They are intelligent and eager to please and do great with obedience training. They excel in obedience, agility, flyball, Frisbee, herding, and tracking competitions. They get along very well with respectful children, but parents need to be aware that Corgis might try to herd kids. (They also might try to herd other animals and your houseguests.) Most Corgis like to be with other cats and dogs. They are adaptable dogs and can live anywhere as long as they get walked, but they do like to bark, so close neighbors might object. While personalities differ within the breed, in general, the Corgi is even-tempered, hardy, friendly, loyal and loving. And they are always full of fun.</p>

        <p>If you are looking for a true best friend, the Bullmastiff might be for you. These large and powerful dogs make excellent companions because they are so loyal and protective. They will want to go with you everywhere, be part of everything you do, and will not do well behaviorally if they do not get the attention they crave. They are good with children and are protective of them. They are quiet dogs, but will bark loudly when they sense a threat. They are not always good with other dogs, and can show dog aggression, so it is important to socialize them early in life. They are natural guard dogs and can be territorial to a fault. While it is great that they will protect you with their life, they can also get into trouble by not allowing any other animals to trespass onto "their" property. Bullmastiffs are faithful, sensitive, intelligent, and eager to please. They are laidback (unless threatened), fearless, active, docile, spirited, and famous for the unconditional love they show their humans. They are confident and can sometimes be stubborn. Their famous flaw is their slobber. You need to be prepared to keep a slobber rag in every room in your home, and you might consider offering one to your guests when they walk through your door, as your Bullmastiff will most certainly slobber on them as well -- Bullmastiffs do not discriminate with their slobber. Bullmastiffs are active but do not require excessive exercise, and can live happily anywhere, including apartments, as long as they have lots of company and are given lots of attention.</p>
